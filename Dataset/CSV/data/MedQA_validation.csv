Two researchers involved in the study decide to measure blood glucose concentration and lipid profile postprandially (i.e. after a meal), as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Their study group consists of 16 women over 50 years of age who live in the neighborhood in a small town where the clinic is located. The women are given the supplement in the form of a pill, which they take during a high-fat meal or 15 minutes prior to eating. Their results indicate that the supplement can reduce the postprandial glycemic and lipid response, as well as lower blood pressure. Based on their conclusions, the researchers decided to put the product on the market and to conduct a nation-wide marketing campaign.
